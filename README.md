# BigData_CS644

Big Data Assignments and Project which i have done in my Masters at NJIT under Course CS644

# Assignment 1:

n one of the VM instances you created in HW2, do the following:

1. Download, install, and run the latest release of Apache Hadoop in a non-distributed or local mode (standalone): http://hadoop.apache.org/releases.html
2. Develop and test a MapReduce-based approach in your Hadoop system to find all the missing Poker cards.

Submission requirements: A zipped file that contains:

1. A text file that contains a random number (<52) of different Poker cards (each card is represented by both its rank and suit)
2. A text file that contains all the missing Poker cards identified by your MapReduce solution
3. The java programs of your MapReduce solution


# Assignment 2:

On the VM instance where you installed Hadoop in HW3, do the following:

1. Download, install, and run a stable release of Apache HBase: https://hbase.apache.org/downloads.html
2. Expand your MapReduce program developed in HW3 to i) store all the missing Poker cards in HBase and ii) count the number of records in the generated HBase table.
3. Run the expanded MapReduce program in your Hadoop-HBase system.

Submission requirements: A zipped file that contains

1. A text file that contains a random number (<52) of different Poker cards (each card is represented by both its rank and suit)
2. A text file that contains all the missing Poker cards identified by your expanded MapReduce solution
3. A Screenshot showing that the Hadoop-HBase system is running
4. A Screenshot showing that new records of all the missing Poker cards have been stored in HBase
5. The modified java programs of your MapReduce solution integrated with HBase
